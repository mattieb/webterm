# webterm

Because I wanted a terminal app neither sang nor danced.

webterm is a simple [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) terminal app that primarily supports macOS, but also has very basic Windows support.

## Building

To get started:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

## Using the Electron app

In the [app](./app) directory:

```shell
npm start
```

A standalone app can be built:

```shell
npm run build:app
```
