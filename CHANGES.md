# 3.2.2

Update packages, including "brace-expansion" (transitive dependency), which had a potential security issue.

# 3.2.1

Fixed the Mac app being unable to launch.

# 3.2.0

This version fixes an issue with some emoji rendering. Previously, characters like "ðŸ™‚" might have the next character overwrite their right half.

# 3.1.0

This version introduces basic Windows compatibility. Like on Unix, if the the SHELL environment variable is set, it should use thatâ€”but if not, it will search for PowerShell, preferring recent versions, or falling back to the version built in to Windows.

# 3.0.0

This version drops the browser version in favor of a simple, straightforward app.

Dependencies have been upgraded across the board, and the build process has been completely overhauled.

# Pre-3.0.0

Before 3.0.0, a lot happened. It wasn't kept track of particularly well.
